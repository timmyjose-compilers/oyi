The [bfc](https://github.com/Wilfred/bfc) project is an example of a working LLVM-backend in Rust using [llvm-sys](https://crates.io/crates/llvm-sys). This works fine on LLVM11 (current as of date). This increases my confidence that I can use Rust and `llvm-sys`
as the bootstrap language and framework, respectively, for Oyi.
